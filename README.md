# 🧪 Equilibrium Constant Simulator

An interactive web-based tool designed to help students visualize and understand chemical equilibrium, reaction quotients, and Le Châtelier’s Principle through real-time simulations and dynamic graphs.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of my IB Computer Science SL Internal Assessment. The goal is to assist high school chemistry students and teachers by providing a simple, visual, and interactive tool for simulating reversible reactions and equilibrium conditions.

## 📚 Features

- 🔄 **Equilibrium Calculator**  
  Enter initial concentrations and an equilibrium constant (K) to simulate a reaction's behavior and see real-time graphical updates.

- 📉 **Dynamic Chart Visualization**  
  Uses Chart.js to display concentration changes in a clear bar chart format.

- ⚛️ **Particle Simulator**  
  HTML5 Canvas-based animation to visually represent reactants and products in a system approaching equilibrium.

- ⚖️ **Reaction Quotient Calculator (Q vs. K)**  
  Compare Q to K to determine the direction of the reaction shift.

- 🧬 **Le Châtelier’s Principle Page**  
  Text-based learning section explaining how changes in concentration affect equilibrium.

- ✅ **Responsive and Install-Free**  
  Works on school-managed Chromebooks, tablets, and desktop browsers — no downloads required.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 / CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)  
- HTML5 Canvas API  
- Hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or [view it online](https://jtd07.github.io/IB-CS-SL-IA/)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or follow links to each tool)
3. Use the navigation bar to access:
   - Equilibrium Calculator
   - Reaction Quotient Tool
   - Le Châtelier’s Principle Info
   - Particle Simulator
4. Input values and observe real-time changes!

## 🧪 Educational Goals

- Help students visualize how K and initial concentrations affect equilibrium.
- Provide teachers with a classroom-friendly, visual demonstration tool.
- Allow for experimentation and self-guided learning through input and simulation.
